<p class="center">UNCLE SAM'S PLACE AND PROSPECTS IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS.</p>

<p class="cap">IT is exactly a year and a day since Oswego, responding to
the President's call, sent away her modest quota of citizen-soldiery
to the war with Spain. A novel and inspiring scene,
whose meaning, perhaps, we did not wholly take in at the
time: the flag of the Republic borne away from the precincts
of the city at the head of a body of men of peaceful pursuits,
destined, as we supposed, to invade the soil of an alien foe.</p>

<p class="indent">The event proved otherwise. Our neighbors were not to
pass the boundaries of their native land, but with equal gallantry
they were to perform the part of those who "also
serve," although they "only stand and wait." Their part
was not to scale the awful hill at San Juan, to give their
bodies to the noisome vermin of the Cuban chaparral, or to
lie down in death upon the fever-stricken rice-fields of Luzon.
Nevertheless they partook in the glory of those victories won
by their more fortunate comrades, to the honor and credit of
the entire army of the United States. Theirs also is an
equal part in the renown which all the world now accords to
that new and formidable factor in warfare&mdash;the American
Volunteer.</p>

<p class="indent">Truly a May day long to be remembered. Even as we
followed the flag to the confines of the town news came from
a distant land where that same beloved standard had been
carried to victory and undying glory. In the far-away harbor
of Manila a gallant officer had awaked that morning unknown
to fame, but before he slept he had written the name of
George Dewey upon the imperishable scroll with that of
Drake, and Nelson, and Perry, and Farragut; destroyed the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
power and prestige of Spain in the East&mdash;a fabric four centuries
in building, but toppled over in as many hours; annexed
a new and splendid territory to our domain, and&mdash;most
important of all&mdash;launched the Republic upon a new and
greater career.</p>

<p class="indent">A wonderful day indeed, and the first of many that were
to make the twelvemonth just concluded one of the most, if
not the most important in our history. He is a dull citizen of
the Republic, indeed, who does not see in this swift succession
of events a significance wide and deep. An ancient
regime has been swept from our hemisphere and relegated to
the rubbish heap of nations. Our flag flies not only in the
Antilles but in mid-Pacific, by token that that illimitable
ocean is now to us an inland lake. Our army and navy,
posted at China's doorway to uphold our place in the perennial
struggle for mastery in the East, is a notification to the
great powers that henceforth they have to reckon with another
as formidable&mdash;perhaps, also, as rapacious&mdash;as themselves.
"You must understand," said Mr. Speaker Reed
the other day to a distinguished British visitor, "that we
have burst our swaddling-clothes." And in that jocular epigram
lies a meaning almost beyond words to express.</p>

<p class="indent">If we ourselves fail to take in the full significance of these
recent events&mdash;and it would appear that some of us do&mdash;our
neighbors in Europe and Asia are not so dull. Five and
twenty years ago Von Moltke turned away from our civil war
as unworthy the study of a soldier. It was, he said contemptuously,
"a conflict of armed mobs."</p>

<p class="indent">But mark the instructive power of our recent victories. A
surviving countryman and colleague of Von Moltke, discussing
the progress of our arms in Manila, the courage, intelligence
and perfect discipline of our "raw militia," uttered
recently this truly significant warning: "Here is a new
power with which we all must reckon&mdash;a new giant, as yet
ignorant of his strength. He can, if need be, muster ten millions
of men, who in three months will be veteran soldiers,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
the equals if not the superiors of the best troops in Europe.
It is a menace to the world's peace."</p>

<p class="indent">And, "It would be absurd," writes an English military
officer who looked on as a critic and student of war at the
charge up San Juan hill, "to compare with those men the
finest soldiers in Germany, France, Russia or England. Their
equals do not exist."</p>

<p class="indent">Are we indeed a "menace to the world's peace," or only
to those who would disturb that peace? The Europeans
speak from their own point of view as jealous rivals, set to
watch each other and match force with force, controlment
with controlment. It is a saying of diplomacy that in the
division of labor between the powers of Europe, Russia is to
watch Northern Asia, England to guard India, and Germany
to preserve the balance of power on the continent of Europe.</p>

<p class="indent">Are we to have part or lot in this complex assignment of
duties? That is but one of many questions that rise before us
as we contemplate the events of the past year. No other year
in our history, perhaps, has been so rich in performance, so
crowded with great and significant events. What of the year
to come? What of the years that stretch out before us as
we approach the threshold of the new century? Are we
entered in the international handicap for the grand prize of
empire and world-wide ascendancy? Or have we but made
a dash out of our safe retreat, only to return to our historic
isolation as a second-class power&mdash;one of the little, not of
the great of earth?</p>

<p class="indent">Behind a wall of our own building we have in recent years
waxed fat and rich, not to say sordid and corrupt. As we
have been, shall we so continue?</p>

<p class="indent">It is a trite saying that no war leaves a nation where it
finds it. A little more than a year ago our Uncle Samuel
shouldered his musket and set forth to rid his southern doorway
of a certain yellow, yelping cur which for years had been
a nuisance if not a menace to his peace. The dog is dead
and its carcass kicked out of sight. But is that all? We
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
learn&mdash;some of us with surprise or even consternation&mdash;that
certain responsibilities attach to the use of firearms on the
high seas and in the international preserves. Can we dodge
those responsibilities? Ought we to do so if we can? Will
it even pay?</p>

<p class="indent">We have discovered&mdash;once more with something like surprise&mdash;that
war, even if undertaken in the "sacred cause of
humanity," is something more than mere burning of powder.
Whatever our original purpose, we have new territory on our
hands. We cannot kick Spain out of Cuba, even in the cause
of philanthropy, and leave the island to Cuban savagery, for
that is no better than the savagery of Spain.</p>

<p class="indent">Similarly in the Philippines. If Admiral Dewey, after
sinking Montojo's fleet a year and a day ago, had sailed away,
as some Americans seem to think he ought to have done, he
would have merited court-martial for himself and the world's
scorn, contempt and execration for his country. He had no
license to burn American powder and pour out American
blood to further the ambitions of Aguinaldo, or win colonies
in the far East for Germany. Dewey's real victory was won,
not on that spectacular first of May, but in the weary, dreary
months following, when, with infinite patience, unsleeping
watchfulness and the tact of true genius, he kept the peace in
the waters that rolled above the sunken Spanish fleet; whispered
words of friendly warning in the ear of the amiable
German, Von Diederichs, and&mdash;greatest of all&mdash;captured
Manila without bloodshed. Let us never cease to thank the
God of Battles that in the Admiral of our Asiatic fleet we
have had a man as well as a fighter&mdash;a modest, earnest, fearless
man, who could not only conquer an enemy but, greater
still, conquer himself, control his natural resentments and
bring his passions in subjection to his conscience. What
might have befallen us before now without such a guardian
of our interests on the scene, it is neither pleasant nor profitable
to speculate.</p>

<p class="indent">But the conflict is not yet over&mdash;perhaps it has not yet even
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>
fairly begun. Assuming, as I suppose we may, that Aguinaldo
is ready to treat for peace, there still remain the allies
of that patriot&mdash;in Asia and Europe, even here in America.
The Philippine chieftain has fought hard and with splendid
prodigality of patriot blood&mdash;not, however, his own. But
three months' experience with the "white devils" who fight
without resting, and especially with "devils" like Funston
and his wild westerners, who "eat bullets" and swim turgid
rivers under fire&mdash;three months of such experience has
caused the Filipinos to revise the estimate of white man's
warfare formed upon their acquaintance with Spain.</p>

<p class="indent">Still remain, however, the watchful Europeans in the East,
who, despite the diplomatic protestations of their respective
governments, would be only too ready to take advantage of
our first misstep or sign of weakness.</p>

<p class="indent">Remain also those peculiar patriots here at home who
have found interest or duty in affording aid and comfort at
long range to their country's foes. Of these American Filipinos
there are several breeds. First, there is the political
breed, who, under the leadership of a distinguished westerner,
are gallantly fighting the administration with a view to the
possibilities of 1900. Of these patriots it is to be observed
that their political instincts have already taught them much.
Not for the first time, they realize that they have misjudged
the public temper. Treachery, in whatever guise, has never
been lovely to the American eye, and I think we may assume
that the Bryan Filipinos will presently discover that they are
on the wrong tack. They will not figure largely in the events
of the future.</p>

<p class="indent">A more troublesome, insistent factor is the Atkinson breed
of Filipinos. This will do as a generic name for a species of
patriots that has never been entirely wanting at any stage of
our national progress. They were called Tories when they
first appeared, to oppose the patriot revolt from Great Britain.
During the War of the Rebellion they earned the name of
Copperheads, from the similarity of their tactics to those of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
the snake in the grass which strikes without warning. These
tactics the Atkinsons are renewing now, without apparent
hope of reward or success, but merely from that perversity
of nature, that inborn contrariness whose existence is to be
explained only on the theory that "it takes all kinds of people
to make a world."</p>

<p class="indent">Of these gentry and their kind, I have only to say that
they may thank their lucky stars that they live and practice
their treacherous devices in a country where the jealousy for
free speech and a free press sometimes permits liberty to
fall into license. The wanton Copperhead may for the present
shelter himself behind the good nature of the people. I
say for the present, for I do not believe that such treasonable
conduct as inciting troops under arms to resist lawful authority
can forever go unpunished; but in the end it will be treated
as it deserves.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> This was written before Mr. Atkinson's treasonable pamphlets had been stopped in the
mails by the Post Office Department.</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">I do not deny to any American citizen the right to entertain
his own opinion as to the wisdom of any public policy,
including that of the administration toward the Philippines.
Nor do I deny that there may be Americans of undoubted
patriotism who conscientiously oppose that policy. But
there are times and occasions for all things; and there are
occasions when open criticism of the Government amounts
to treason. So there are times when it is the duty of every
patriot to support the Government, without regard to private
difference of opinion. As for the present, it is one of those
occasions when the patriot should say, with Winthrop:
"Our country, however bounded or described&mdash;still our
country&mdash;to be cherished in all our hearts; to be defended
by all our hands!"</p>

<p class="indent">There is an hour for debate and there is time for argument,
wherein the Government may easily be shown to be in
the wrong. But in the hour of battle, so long as any armed
foe of the flag is above the sod, the patriot can only exclaim:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
"My country&mdash;may she never be in the wrong; but right or
wrong, my country!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">While we may safely leave to the Government the subjugation
of its enemies at home or abroad, there can be no
harm in discussing here some of the arguments that have
been advanced in all honesty against the policy now generally
known as "imperialism," or "territorial expansion." The
anti-expansionists honestly opposed the annexation of Hawaii;
but Hawaii is already annexed, and as truly a part of the
national domain as Massachusetts or New York. In like
manner Porto Rico is ours, for better, for worse, till death or
dissolution shall us part. As for Cuba, we hold it in trust
for the Cubans, against the time when those enigmatical patriots
shall prove their ability and worthiness to rule themselves
or their country. When is that time to come? We
ourselves are to be the judges. I am not a prophet nor the
son of a prophet, but I hold it to be vastly significant that
the majority of intelligent Cuban <i>civilians</i> seem to look forward,
not with pleasure but with dread to that much-talked-of
millennium, "Cuba for the Cubans."</p>

<p class="indent">The tendency of the times, in government as in commerce,
is clearly centripetal, not centrifugal. There is not an
island in the West Indies whose condition would not be improved
by annexation to this Republic; and, after all, self-interest
is the main-spring of all national policies. I would
rather predict that Canada and British America, Mexico and
the Central American states are destined for ultimate (and
peaceful) admission to this Union, than that we are to take a
single backward step along the lines so clearly laid down by
the war with Spain.</p>

<p class="indent">But the Philippines present to the eye another and a
broader question. Here is an archipelago removed from our
center of population by one-half the circumference of the
globe; peopled by a race&mdash;or, rather, races&mdash;wholly alien
to any hitherto admitted to our citizenship, and&mdash;most important
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
of all&mdash;plunged into the very vortex of that boiling
cauldron known as the Eastern question.</p>

<p class="indent">What is to be our policy toward those remote islands?&mdash;to
retain them or to let them go?</p>

<p class="indent">The objections that have thus far been raised to our retention
of the Philippines come chiefly under these heads: 1,
Constitutional; 2, Our "historic policy;" 3, Utility or self-interest.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">And first as to the constitutional questions involved. For
so young a nation the United States has already passed
through numerous crises, chiefly arising over the acquisition
of new territory, and it is noteworthy that in each of these the
policy of the Government has been opposed by a conscientious
minority on the plea of alleged unconstitutionality.
Once more we are warned, in the present crisis, that the acquisition
and proposed retention of the Philippines are without
warrant in the constitution of the United States.</p>

<p class="indent">Far be it from me to breathe disrespect for a document so
respectable, but there can be no treason in pointing out the
perfectly obvious fact that no constitution, and especially no
written constitution, can be stronger than the men who made
it; it cannot be&mdash;it is not&mdash;so strong as the men for whom
it is made, because in them is vested the power to amend or
even to annul it.</p>

<p class="indent">The fathers of the Republic were wise in their generation;
rarely, if ever, has a country been so blessed in the character
of its founders as ours. But they were human, and hence
fallible; mere men, and therefore not endowed with the gift
of prophecy. They themselves would have been the first to
disclaim such an attribute. They drafted a constitution admirably
suited for the needs of thirteen colonies stretched
along the Atlantic coast, recently liberated by the bravery of
their own citizens from the tyranny of a stupid and stiff-necked
English monarch and ministry. And then, proud,
serene and happy in the consciousness of duty well done,
they were gathered to the bosom of their fathers.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
The fathers and founders died, but the Republic lived on.
Year by year it grew and waxed greater. No student of our
history need be told that every instance of expansion of our
territory presented unsolved problems beyond the apparent
scope of the parchment constitution; or that as each of these
occasions arose, arose also a party to declare that the constitution
<i>could not</i> be stretched to meet the demand. Yet the
growth continued and the constitution survived.</p>

<p class="indent">I do not presume to read the constitution of the United
States for this or any other audience&mdash;that is a work beyond
my powers, and, I apprehend, beyond those of many who
consider themselves of the "constitutional party." But there
may be instruction in recalling a few of the instances in our
history in which the constitutionally impossible has been
nevertheless accomplished, and that, too, without harm to
the Republic.</p>

<p class="indent">Thomas Jefferson, being a democrat and "strict constructionist,"
demanded an amendment to the constitution to
confirm the Louisiana purchase; but not, it will be remembered,
until after the purchase had been made, constitution or
no constitution.</p>

<p class="indent">Andrew Jackson, another democrat, has never been rebuked
by posterity for marching into Florida, arresting and
hanging Ambuster and his fellow spies on what was then
Spanish territory; yet in so doing President Jackson thrust
his hob-nailed Tennessee boots clean through the sacred
parchment. It has been well said that success is an unwritten
law seldom reversed by the courts. Certainly neither the
courts nor Jackson's fellow strict-constructionists have ever
rebuked him for the "unconstitutional act."</p>

<p class="indent">Passing over the Mexican war and the acquisition of Texas,
California and New Mexico, a series of acts very damaging to
the dignity of the constitution, let us come at one step to the
most conspicuous breach of the constitution in all our history&mdash;the
War of the Rebellion.</p>

<p class="indent">There is not a line in the constitution expressly permitting
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
the secession of a state, though so eminent an
authority as the late Judge Thomas M. Cooley, himself a
Northerner and a Union man of undoubted loyalty, plainly
intimates in his "Constitutional Limitations" that at least
historical precedent was on the side of secession. But neither
is there authority in the constitution for the invasion
of a state by the federal army, unless at the request of the
state authorities; yet the Southern states seceded, and President
Lincoln marched the Northern armies whithersoever
secession and rebellion showed their heads. Still more recently,
President Cleveland sent federal troops into Illinois
to quell riotous strikers, against the protest of the Governor;
yet posterity sustains both presidents in their acts&mdash;perhaps
even thanks them for the precedent&mdash;whatever the cost to
the constitution.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the repression of the rebellion, posterity, including
many of the seceding "strict constructionists," now concede
that equity, common sense and the instinct of self-preservation
amply justified any possible breach of the constitution
committed for the preservation of the Union. A federation
of states holding together only at the will of all its component
parts would hardly have been worth saving; so that if the
constitution was on the side of the seceders, why&mdash;so much
the worse for the constitution.</p>

<p class="indent">It was during the War of the Rebellion, too, that a
legislature of Virginia met in Alexandria and passed a law
cutting the state in two, to erect the new state of West
Virginia. Now, article 4, section 3, of the United States
constitution expressly declares that "no state shall be
formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other
state, nor any state be formed by the junction of two or
more states or parts of states, without the consent of the
legislatures of the states concerned and of the Congress."
Yet the state of West Virginia is a historical, political and
geographical fact, notwithstanding that the precedent thus
established is a dangerous one, and the division wrought
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
great injustice to the Old Dominion in throwing upon her
shoulders the entire debt of the original state. Here was not
only a violation of the constitution, but a "historical crime;"
yet both constitution and the crime remain to vex the souls of
the strict constructionists and to remind us all how weak a
thing is any constitution when it blocks the way of a popular
demand.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no need to multiply instances, though there are
many others&mdash;notably during the period of "reconstructing"
the conquered states after the war. The constitution offers
no more substantial obstacle to the acquisition of territory in
the Philippines than it did in the other cases cited, provided
only that public expediency and the demand of the people are
on the other side.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Scarcely less importance is attributed by the anti-expansionists
to our alleged "historical <i>policy of isolation</i>," which,
we are told, would be violated by thrusting our hands as a
nation into the larger affairs of international politics. For
some reason the idea seems to prevail that George Washington
and other statesmen of his period designed the Republic
for a remote, parochial career, hedged about by a Chinese
wall, excluding all foreign influence from our affairs and
retaining our own energies within our own boundaries.
"America for the Americans," is the shibboleth of this school
of political philosophers, and they really seem to believe that
the Republic will in some way be happier and richer if we
keep aloof entirely and forever from the rest of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, the only nation on earth that has ever
maintained such a policy to its logical end and conclusion is
China, and China is now awaiting participation in a grand
international banquet, whereat, like Polonius, she is not to
eat but to be eaten.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the United States, if any nation ever came into
existence and has lived under the fierce light of international
politics, it has been this Republic of ours. To be sure, our
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
trade policy of recent years has been framed on the Chinese
model&mdash;"America for the Americans"&mdash;and in consequence
we are now brought face to face with a retaliatory policy on
the part of the powers of continental Europe which may easily
shut us out of the world's market at the hour of our greatest
need. But of that, more later on.</p>

<p class="indent">In point of fact, we have been a "world power" from the
very moment of our birth as a nation, or even before it. Our
Declaration of Independence, that beautiful synthesis of paradoxes,
became from the moment of its publication a powerful
factor in the world's progress. "Among all peoples,"
says Professor Tyler, "it has everywhere been associated
with the assertion of the natural rights of man. To every
struggling nation it has been a model and an inspiration."
And Buckle, the English historian, declares that its effect in
hastening the French Revolution "was most remarkable."
No state paper of modern times has exercised so wide an
authority.</p>

<p class="indent">Geographically, we are a nation lying athwart a continent,
from ocean to ocean, and in the immediate highway of the
world's traffic from west to east and from east to west. Between
1821 and 1898 no less than eighteen millions of Europeans
landed upon our shores to become a part of our citizenship
and complete its truly cosmopolitan character.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the policy of our Government, it has been that of a
world power from the start. Almost our first important act
as a government was to cast in our lot with France, for the
express purpose of disturbing the balance of power in Europe.
And that purpose was realized. In December, 1776, Congress
sent out a fleet of privateers which became a scourge to our
enemies on the high seas. As early as 1777, we had commissioners,
who soon became ministers, at Paris, taking active
and important part in a conference of the powers. Five years
later, Franklin, John Adams and Jay sat in the congress at
Paris, "almost as arbiters," a contemporary record says, so
powerful was their voice in the conference.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
Washington's much-talked-of proclamation of neutrality,
says Professor Bushnell Hart, was never intended to keep the
United States from contact or entanglement with European
powers, but only so wisely to shape our course (at that time)
that we should be free to fight or keep the peace as our interest
should dictate.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the United States which first ventured to send a
fleet to the Mediterranean to suppress the Barbary pirates&mdash;an
act from which all the civilized world benefited. Indeed,
it is within the limits of truth to say that the period of our
liveliest intercourse with foreign powers was the identical
period of "the fathers" who are so often and so falsely
quoted as urging the policy of isolation that would sooner or
later reduce us to the condition of the Chinese Empire.</p>

<p class="indent">Our interests in the far East began as early as 1785, when
the ship <i>Empress of New York</i> came home from her first
Chinese voyage to enrich her owners with the traffic in furs
and ginseng. It is a fact too soon forgotten that our title to
Oregon was founded upon the early establishment on that
remote coast of a trading-post for our Chinese trade.</p>

<p class="indent">As long ago as 1851, the native rulers of Hawaii begged&mdash;nay,
even insisted&mdash;that our government annex those
islands, whose people had already been familiar with our flag
for years. Annexation did not take place until nearly half a
century later, but the episode suffices to prove that even at
that early day we were a world power in all that the term
implies.</p>

<p class="indent">Three years later&mdash;in 1854&mdash;Oliver Hazard Perry, Commodore
of the United States navy, battered down the gates
of Nagasaki, and by the method which England so successfully
employed toward China, established "treaty relations"
between the Yankees of the East and of the West.</p>

<p class="indent">This brings us, after a view necessarily imperfect and cursory,
very nearly to the War of the Rebellion. That struggle,
and the absorbing internal questions which led up to it,
kept us very busy at home, though both the North and the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
South, appreciating the importance of foreign sympathy and
moral support, kept their emissaries constantly at the various
courts of Europe. The international episodes of the war
may be said in one sense to afford the most interesting chapters
in its history. Certainly they should suffice to convince
us that, even in the heat of that internal struggle, our affairs
formed a part of the business of the outside world; so complete
is the interdependence of nations. Nor need it be
recalled that the war was scarcely at an end before Mr.
Seward had occasion to warn Napoleon III. out of Mexico,
and thus topple over a scheme of aggression involving at
least two of the great powers of Europe.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It has been necessary to pass over with greater haste than
I could have wished these arguments of the anti-expansionists,
because there are other phases of the question which, to
my mind at least, are of vastly greater importance; for I do
not deny that there are obstacles in the path of territorial
expansion.</p>

<p class="indent">Assuming the present war of subjugation to be brought to
a successful issue; that the Filipinos acknowledge both the
hopelessness of their cause and the justice of ours, as in the end
they must, our difficulties are not yet finished. We have still
to consider the remoteness of the archipelago, the savagery of
many of the native tribes, the tropical climate, and the dregs
of four centuries of Spanish misrule.</p>

<p class="indent">The average temperature in the Philippines, according to
the imperfect statistics collated by the Spanish at Manila, is
much too high for the comfort of any man accustomed to the
climate of our so-called temperate zone. Professor Dean
Worcester, of our Philippine Commission, who spent three
and a half years in the islands as a naturalist, says that in all
that time he never experienced a day in which a white man
could work hard for many hours together in comfort, or even
in safety. The coolest months are December and January,
but the lowest temperature known at this period of mid-winter
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
is 71 degrees. During the remainder of the year the mercury
often mounts above 90 degrees, and not infrequently to 100
degrees. The effects of the heat, moreover, are aggravated
by the humidity of the atmosphere, so that it saps the vitality
and enfeebles the stoutest constitution.</p>

<p class="indent">These conditions are arduous, but by no means intolerable.
White men <i>do</i> live in the islands and steadily work without
impairing their health. The absence of sudden changes
enables one to dress for the climate without fear of catching
cold. Herein the climate is preferable to that of some of our
larger cities, such as New York or St. Louis, where intense
heat with humidity alternate with sudden chills.</p>

<p class="indent">Malarial fever is one of the curses of the Philippines; but
this disease is found in all countries imperfectly tilled and
drained, and there, as elsewhere, it disappears in the face of
cleanliness and intelligent sanitation. Some cities and districts
which at one time were almost wholly uninhabitable
have been freed entirely of malaria by thorough drainage.
The Spanish, with characteristic indolence, have as a rule
endured the ravages of the disease rather than incur the cost
and labor of preventive measures. Weyler&mdash;the dreadful,
blood-drinking Weyler&mdash;who was for a time Captain-General
of the Philippines, at one time lost the greater part of his
army from a fever which might have been averted with proper
care. Cholera is not epidemic in the Philippines; neither is
smallpox, though both diseases have at different times swept
through cities and districts in the train of filth and carelessness.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the natives, Professor Worcester gives them, on
the whole, a fairly good character. The aboriginal tribes,
Negritoes, or "little niggers," are, like our own Indians, nearly
extinct. The pagan Malays are bold, warlike, treacherous,
but they are not numerous, being confined largely to the
northern islands, and even the Spaniards were able, by keeping
firearms out of their reach, to prevent them from becoming
seriously dangerous. The Mohammedan Malays are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
more formidable. To the fierceness and treachery of their
pagan congeners, their faith has added a savage fanaticism
which takes the form of special hatred for the Christian.
They are fatalists, and hence fearless in battle, and their
priests teach them that for every Christian slain they will be
rewarded with a new peri in paradise.</p>

<p class="indent">There are forty thousand Chinese in the islands, including
some coolies, but the greater part are engaged in retail trade,
which in some districts they entirely monopolize. Scarcely
any village is without its Chinese shop.</p>

<p class="indent">The most numerous and important portion of the population
is the half-caste element&mdash;Malay-Chinese and Malay-Caucasian,
generally Spanish. The creole Spaniards affect
to despise these "half-cousins," especially the friars, though
it is said that the friars are responsible for the existence
of most of them. As a matter of fact, however, the half-castes
constitute the great "middle classes" of the population,
and are far and away the most tractable, intelligent, and
in every way promising for the purposes of a civilized government.
Not a few of them are intelligent and fairly educated.
Aguinaldo himself is said to be a Malay-Chinese.
The Spaniards, never violently addicted to labor, allowed
these people to do the greater part of such work as shop-tending,
bookkeeping, etc., so that, in the opinion of Professor
Worcester, they would be available for the minor positions
of government, under the direction of American chiefs.</p>

<p class="indent">Much will depend on how these half-castes are treated.
Senor Nicholas Estévanez, at one time Spanish Minister of
War, gives friendly warning to the Americans, not to copy the
mistakes of his own countrymen in taking for granted the
inferiority of the native Filipinos. This was one stumbling-block
to the peacefulness of Spanish rule in the islands,
though not, of course, the only one. In a very interesting
article in the <i>North American Review</i>, Senor Estévanez tells
of the trials and injustices endured by these really patient and
peaceful people at the hands of "impure priests and merchants
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
without a conscience." Disraeli said, "Race is the key
to history." But race distinctions can be overworked, and if
our people enter upon the government of the islands too
strongly prepossessed with the idea of their own superiority,
they will simply be making unnecessary trouble for themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">In one respect at least we shall start with a great advantage
over the Spanish. It is not easy to picture American
rulers oppressing a subject race on the score of religion.
The Spanish, on the other hand, made baptism the test of
loyalty from the very start. "They wanted," says Senor
Estévanez, "no subjects who would not begin by having
water poured on their heads." The natives, on the other
hand, were willing to submit in all else, but insisted on
retaining their religion. "So, for the sake of a few drops of
water, we had three centuries of war."</p>

<p class="indent">Such a people is not devoid of sterling qualities. Troy
itself stood out for only ten years against the Greeks; Mindanao
resisted the Spaniards for three hundred years. If we
profit by the example of our predecessors we may accomplish
in a few months what they failed to do in all that long period.</p>

<p class="indent">The game is well worth the candle. All authentic accounts
of the islands agree that they are rich beyond computation in
natural resources&mdash;forest, mine, and soil. The Spaniards
have, even in their slothful, unskilled and clumsy fashion,
taken out untold wealth; but they only scratched the field;
most of what remains is practically virgin soil. True, there
is lack of all civilized methods; railroads must be built and
labor is hard to find. But such difficulties have never yet
daunted a virile race, and they will not for long deter the
Americans.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The difficulties of which I have spoken thus far are material;
there are others much deeper in their origin and more
apt to give pause to this giant enterprise. I refer now to
what might be called the subjective obstacles to success; the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
qualities inherent in ourselves and in our own government
which rise up now to impede the pathway to success.</p>

<p class="indent">"Providence protects little children and the United
States," is a saying in the diplomatic world, referring to the
good luck, as some call it, or the special gift for rising to
sudden emergencies, as we ourselves prefer to say, which in
many difficult crises has kept us safe from harm or helped us
to success. But now, as Speaker Reed said the other day,
"we have burst our swaddling-clothes." We have, let us
hope, put away childish things and put on the garment of
national manhood. As one of the great powers we must no
longer rely upon child-luck. The great task before us calls
for the strength, soberness and consistency of the adult.</p>

<p class="indent">It will not, for example, be consistent with the character
of a world power to apply to the government of new colonies
the same methods, or lack of method, that has prevailed in
the government of our cities and some of our states. We
cannot hope for success if we carry the spoils system into the
difficult administration of foreign lands and people. Colonial
work calls for special fitness in the civil service, for long and
careful training. Shall we turn it over to the politicians,
who have thus far, with some honorable exceptions, monopolized
our diplomatic service. As a rule, our consuls and
ministers, and even our ambassadors, have been patriots with
"claims upon the administration"&mdash;not based upon special
education and fitness, but for political service rendered.
As a result, many&mdash;perhaps even a majority&mdash;of our representatives
abroad have distinguished themselves and their
country by such antics as were explained or forgiven only because
the men <i>were</i> Americans, and therefore protected by
that "special providence" of which I have spoken. Is it
imagined that we can administer colonies after this method?
If so, a great and painful surprise is in store for us.</p>

<p class="indent">For the present administration it must be said that the
President's choice of men for work in the new colonies
inspires the hope of better things. In the Philippine Commission,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
for example, every man has justified his selection by
special ability or experience, or both. If this course be followed
to the end the nation is relieved at the start of a
grave anxiety. Let us hope that it is so.</p>

<p class="indent">But with even the best intentions we have difficulties to
face that are not due to any fault of our own, but are rather
inherent in our institutions, in our form of government.
Ours is a democracy, with all the virtues and all the defects
of that form of government. It is obvious that such work
as is now to be done in the East calls for a strong central
executive force. Russia has been able to fortify her position
in the East not only because she is rich and powerful,
but because her form of government is an autocracy. Germany
is, in name at least, a constitutional monarchy, but it is
because her government owns and administers the railroads,
and a powerful and perfectly organized militarism permeates
the whole fabric, that she has been able to make such advance
as a world power since she became an empire at Versailles.
There is no time here to elaborate these propositions,
but they are obviously true.</p>

<p class="indent">Our government, on the other hand, is designedly weak
in the executive and strong in the legislative department.
When we broke away, at the beginning of our history, from
a monarchy and from a monarch who was impatient of legislative
interference, the pendulum swang to the other side,
carrying us to the opposite extreme. We safeguarded ourselves
against the possibility of a central power of overweening
strength. And all our history has been the history
of a powerful legislative and a comparatively weak executive.
To us bureaucracy is hateful. We protest as a people
against an office-holding class. Every citizen feels that he
too may become an office-holder&mdash;is looking forward, possibly,
to that consummation. This may explain the indulgence
with which we regard the faults of those actually in
office. If at the end of its term in office an administration is
able to account in some way for all the money it has handled,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span>
no further questions are asked. As to the quality of the service
rendered for the money, that is a matter not to be dwelt
upon with painful emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">Such laxity will hardly suffice for the administration
of colonies planted amidst remote peoples of another race,
requiring delicate handling and the tactful management
which can come only from special knowledge and training.
Nor is such special knowledge to be gained in the brief term
of one administration's power. Much less can the matter be
left to the national luck or even the national cleverness.
"There are some difficulties," said one of our public men
recently, "that do not yield to mere enthusiasm." We must
have a strong administrative arm to the government, and the
question is, how such an adjunct is to be fitted upon the existing
institutions, theories and traditions of our government.
I do not doubt that it <i>will</i> be; simply point out that here is
a matter for profound thought and honest endeavor along
new lines. "There is no form of government," said Dr.
Franklin to his colleagues in the federal convention, "that
may not be a blessing if it is well administered." There is
no legitimate task or emergency to which our government
may not prove adequate if wisely and liberally directed. We
cannot throw overboard the wisdom of our fathers, but we
are bound to construe the precepts they laid down in the light
of new emergencies as they arise. The words of Lincoln,
uttered in 1860 at Cooper Union, when the extension or repression
of slavery was before the country as an issue, are
equally applicable to the issue which confronts us now:</p>

<blockquote><p class="indent">"I do not say that we are bound to follow implicitly
in whatever our fathers did. To do that would
be to discard the lights of current experience, to
reject all progress, all improvement. What I do say
is that if we would supplant the opinions and policy
of the fathers in any case, we should do so on evidence
so conclusive that even their great authority,
fairly considered and weighed, cannot stand."</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
I firmly believe that we shall be able to develop for our
new colonies an administrative branch sufficiently strong for
the successful conduct of their affairs and yet preserve all
the essentials of republican government.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be conceded that the viceregal office, with its regal
functions and authority, is essential to British rule in India.
Yet, properly considered, England is as truly a democracy as
the United States.</p>

<p class="indent">Indeed, there is both education and inspiration for us in
the study of the British rule in India. Not by any means
that it is perfect&mdash;what human institution is perfect? Man
is selfish, thoughtless, cruel. The opium traffic, both in
India and China, and the introduction of the whiskey "peg"
among a "heathen" race, which, with all its faults, preserved
for so many centuries the virtue of temperance&mdash;these are
blots&mdash;big, dark, indelible blots&mdash;on the good name of England.
Nor is it wholly without reason that the complaint is
so often made that legislation for India is too often inspired
by the desires of Birmingham and Manchester, rather than
by the needs of Hindustan.</p>

<p class="indent">But there are spots on the sun of a splendid performance.
There are seven thousand miles of "black water"
between the British Isles and Hindustan. The population of
the former is thirty-five millions; of the latter, two hundred
and fifty millions&mdash;one-fifth of the human race. Yet this vast
peninsular is held in absolute subjection by the people of
those "tight little isles" so far away. In the whole civil and
military establishment of British India there are but one hundred
thousand whites, as against nearly twice that number of
natives. How small a numerical force to rule those teeming
millions! And yet, year by year the British element grows
smaller and the native element larger and more potent in the
government of India. "The English," says Mr. G. W. Steevens
in a recent letter to the London <i>Mail</i>, "are still the dominant
race, but the real ruler of India is the Babu."</p>

<p class="indent">If the natives were a peaceful, intelligent, or even a homogeneous
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
race, the story would still read like a fairy tale. Far
from it. Three-fourths of the number are Hindus of many
races, sects and schools, but there are sixty million Mohammedans
(more than the total population of the Sultan's domain),
besides Sikhs, Janis, Parsees, etc.,&mdash;a score or more
races of more or less turbulent savages, many of them ready
at a moment's notice to cut the throat of any white man, if
they only dared.</p>

<p class="indent">The climate, at least during the hot season, is almost
death to white men, and certain death to white children.
The English accordingly send their children "home" to be
educated and spend their tender years. This means not only
the anguish of separation but also a heavy expense, which, in
the present depreciated state of the rupee, is hardly borne.</p>

<p class="indent">The native princes, great and small, ignorant for the most
part, idle, bigoted, superstitious, and naturally jealous of
white rule, do what they can to block the wheels of progress
and embarrass the government. Herein they have the eager
co-operation of the priests, who are jealous of foreign influence
and often able to inflame the people into open resistance
to the most wholesome orders and regulations. Popular
ignorance and superstition lend themselves readily to such
mischievous designs. A mutiny may be started by a government
order to build a sewer or to vaccinate the inhabitants of
a village. It is easy for the priests to persuade their docile
charges that vaccination is witchcraft and an instrument of the
devil. The policy of the government is tender of native sensibilities,
and humors religious and caste distinctions; but the
smallest accident or mistake may precipitate a riot or undo
the good work of years.</p>

<p class="indent">Those who have read Kipling's stories of native Indian
life have a picture more than photographically accurate of
"paternal government" under difficulties. Nor is it inconsistent
with perverse human nature that much of the government's
trouble comes from the well-meant but pernicious
interference of globe-trotting M. P.'s and parochial statesmen
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
who have solved the problem from afar and come out to
India to fan the discontent of pampered natives or aggravate
the perplexities of overworked civil servants, held up to execration
as the "overpaid and aristocratic favorites of a wasteful
government." England, as well as America, has her anti-imperialists.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet, in spite of these and a thousand other difficulties and
discouragements, a great and really good work goes on, making
steadily for the moral and material uplift of the unthankful
blacks. Popular education struggles forward against the
bigotry and deep-rooted folly of ages. Public roads and other
improvements lessen the tremendous distances between field
and market, and so lessen the chances of famine. Rivers are
deflected and canals built to irrigate waste places and make
the desert blossom and bear fruit. Folly and extravagance
are restrained in high places; system is established in place
of chaos, and the hereditary pauper is taught the blessings of
self-support. In something like a century much has been
done to reform abuses which, like the pedigree of a rajah, run
back through many centuries. True, much still remains to be
done; but take it by and with, good and bad together, I know
of no other chapter in history so creditable to the race
as this.</p>

<p class="indent">As I have said, here is a lesson to us, teaching some of the
difficulties we must encounter in the Philippines; but is it
not also an inspiration, showing what may be done by patient
persistence and a high ambition to do our part, in order that
we may leave the world better&mdash;if only a little better&mdash;than
we found it? Such an aim is no less praiseworthy in a nation
than in an individual; is it not especially worthy of a nation
which already, in its short career, has furnished a model of
good government and a plea for human rights the world over?</p>

<p class="indent">But nations, once more like individuals, do not stand
alone in the world, apart from their fellows&mdash;independent,
isolated, self-sufficient. Each is part of a group, scheme or
family, and all are interdependent for help, growth, for their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;26]</span>
very existence. The Philippines, rich and desirable as they
are in themselves and for what they contain, strike the eye of
intelligence with much greater force as a part of that complex
and highly important system generally known as "the
East." At this immediate juncture they are to all the great
powers an object of desire and ambition, by reason of their
nearness and close relation to the great Empire of China. In
the hands of Spain this phase of the islands' importance
was nearly or quite eclipsed, for Spain has no part in the
great game of empire which engrosses the virile and progressive
powers.</p>

<p class="indent">The accident of war has done that which international
laws and comity forbade. Much as the European powers
desired the Philippines, none of them dared to lay hand upon
the islands, fearing not the resistance of Spain, but the jealousy
of their rivals. The explosion of the Maine thus became
a swift and powerful factor in that game of world politics
from which we had up to now kept aloof. In the language of
the philosopher Dooley, few of our people could have answered,
eighteen months ago, whether the Philippines were
"islands or canned goods." They played no part in the
scheme of our national life. Chance has given them into our
hands, and it remains with ourselves to determine whether
we are to turn them to account, not only for themselves, but
for what they may be made, in their relation to other and
larger prizes.</p>

<p class="indent">All Europe has listened with mingled incredulity and exasperation
to the protests of our anti-expansionists against
the annexation of the Philippines. To those who are familiar
with the situation in the East and realize the importance of
China to the West, it seems incredible that a sane and civilized
people should even dream of throwing away so rich a
prize, now that chance had thrown it into their hands. Is
it hypocrisy or ignorance? Europe can see no other explanation.</p>

<p class="indent">But still the opponents of expansion continue to ask,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
What have we to do with China? Why should the United
States concern itself to guard the "open door" in that empire,
or to prevent the establishment of "spheres of influence?"&mdash;the
latter being the polite phrase of diplomacy for
chopping up China and dividing the pieces among the great
powers.</p>

<p class="indent">The plain answer of commerce to these questions is
afforded by the statistics of China's foreign trade. Yonder is
a vast domain with a population estimated at four hundred
and thirty millions&mdash;about one-third of the human race&mdash;largely
dependent for even the simple necessities upon the
outside world.</p>

<p class="indent">England was the first to batter down the ancient gates of
the empire, and she has her reward in that she holds about
sixty-four per cent of China's import trade. England's nearest
competitor is the United States, with eight per cent, the
remaining twenty-eight per cent being divided among the
other powers, with Japan at the head of the list. Our own
share does not at first glance appear very large, but it should
be explained that as a great proportion of our commodities
are carried to China in English bottoms and consigned to
English houses, it is classified as English business&mdash;a part of
the sixty-four per cent. The actual discrepancy, therefore,
is not so great as the apparent. Moreover, though the beginnings
of our trade with China date from the last century, we
have not been an appreciable factor in the market until about
three years ago, since which time our trade has increased at
a rate of speed which has both surprised and alarmed our
competitors.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote"><p class="indent"><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The following account of our exports to China was prepared recently by
an intelligent and reliable newspaper correspondent. It is of interest in this
connection:
</p>

<p class="indent">Exports of merchandise to China in the fiscal year about to end will be
larger than those of any preceding year in our history. Ten years ago our
exports to China were less than $3,000,000, and to China and Hong Kong combined
little more than $6,000,000. In the fiscal year ending 1899, our exports
to China will be more than $13,000,000, and to Hong Kong more than $6,000,000,
making a total of more than $20,000,000, or three times that of a decade
earlier. That the bulk of exports to Hong Kong may properly be considered
as ultimately destined for consumption in China, is shown by the fact that the
official reports of the imports into China show that more than forty-four per
cent of these imports are from the port of Hong Kong. The 1899 exports to
China and Hong Kong combined will show a gain of nearly or quite twenty-five
per cent over those of last year, while the total exports from the United
States for the fiscal year 1899 will be little if any in excess of those of last
year. This shows a more rapid growth in our exports to this part of the world
than elsewhere.

Significant as these figures are, a full understanding of
our trade conditions in the far East, and the importance of
that market to our prospects, can hardly be gained without a
backward glance over the events of the past three decades.</p>

<p class="indent">Up to the collapse of the French at Sedan, or perhaps
until 1873, Great Britain stood without a rival in trade and
manufactures. That year will long be remembered, in England
as in America, as the beginning of the era of low prices.
In England agricultural products were the first to suffer, on
account of the importation of food products from Australia
and the Americas. This movement continued to increase and
British farms proportionately to suffer until, by 1879, that
property, the backbone of English hereditary wealth, ceased
entirely to pay. The sending away of money to buy food,
together with the fall in the prices of home products, so
affected the home supply of gold that, in order to preserve
the equilibrium, the English began to realize on their foreign
investments.</p>

<p class="indent">The greatest panic in history followed. Previous to 1876
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
England had always been able to maintain her expanding
currency and supply the arts with the gold brought in to pay
for her exports. In 1877 the tide turned, and the whole
ensuing decade actually showed a net export of gold amounting
to $11,000,000, besides what went into the melting-pot.
Contraction and the fall of prices continued, and in proportion
the sale of foreign securities. By 1890 England had
brought back enough gold to restore her balance, but at what
a cost to the debtor nations! Argentina and Australia collapsed
in turn, the former pulling down the great Baring concern.
In 1893 disaster overtook the United States, and it is
scarcely exaggeration to say that the Republic was shaken to
the center. Then came the demonetization of silver in India
and the falling rupee, followed by distress amounting almost
to the dissolution of society.</p>

<p class="indent">Such, in brief, is the history of the movement which has
resulted in the titanic struggle for the few remaining open markets
of the world. Falling prices and reduced profits mean
increase of production, which in turn require new markets.
We in the United States had been careful to secure the home
market to ourselves, but in this crisis the home market proved
sadly inadequate. Our manufacturers must needs go forth
and compete with European wages and standards of living
for the markets of the world.</p>

<p class="indent">The story of their success is one of the romances of industry
and trade. In the face of a natural hostility aroused by
our own tariffs, and compelled to pay for a higher standard of
living, our manufacturers have gone into the markets of the
world and undersold their European competitors at every
point. Carrying coals to Newcastle were child's play in comparison
with what these modern captains of industry have
accomplished. The story is told in the statistics of our export
trade: In 1898 the balance of trade in our favor was $2,000,000
for every working day, or more than $600,000,000. For
the first time since the War of the Rebellion, the interest on
our securities held in England is not enough to pay for our
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
exports, and the extinction of our floating debt abroad is
clearly foreshadowed.</p>

<p class="indent">But how long is this to continue? With our experience of
tariffs we need not be reminded that low prices do not command
markets. Continental Europe does not like us. We
saw that during the Spanish war, and we have heard it since
in various impatient declarations of hostility, at Berlin or
Vienna, far more significant than official assurances of distinguished
consideration. Indeed, if Germany, or France, or
Russia does not openly break with us, it is because fear
or prudence is stronger than inclination. The moment any
one or all of them combined feels able to slam the door in our
face without fear of reprisals, the door will be slammed.</p>

<p class="indent">Germany and more especially Russia are straining every
nerve to establish in China "spheres of influence," which is
the polite phrase of diplomacy for cutting up the Celestial
Empire and dividing the pieces among the powers. England,
on the other hand, favors maintaining the integrity of China
and the "open door" of commerce to all comers. It may
be that England's preference is due to the reasonable fear
that at the "spheres-of-influence" game she may be (if she
be not already) beaten by her continental neighbors; whereas
with an "open door" her chances would be as good, if
not better than the others. If so, England is as disinterested
as her neighbors&mdash;and no more so. Each and all are after
China. "China for trade!" is the slogan. Even the pretense
of missionary design has been dropped, so desperate is
the struggle; for China, with her four hundred and thirty
millions of people, is the sole remaining market of the world.
If Germany and Russia get it, they will shut out England,
and the United States as well. Can they do it?</p>

<p class="indent">In his recent tour across our continent, Lord Charles
Beresford openly advocated the co-operation of the United
States and England to secure an undivided China and the
"open door." His argument was simple. England alone
might not, and the United States alone certainly would not,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;31]</span>
be able to secure this end. Together they could hardly fail.
Not that Lord Charles advocated open war. On the contrary,
he pointed out that not a cent need be spent nor a gun fired.
It only needs that the two great English-speaking nations
should declare their joint policy, saying to all the rest of the
world: "China must not be cut to bits. The empire which
has stood for four thousand years must remain." Then to
China herself: "We have saved you from destruction. In
return you must keep your market open to all the world, letting
us build railroads, telegraphs, canals, what not, throughout
your territory. If you don't, we&mdash;England and the
United States&mdash;will do it for you."</p>

<p class="indent">It is an attractive programme. Lord Charles Beresford
may be too confident&mdash;he may even be not entirely candid&mdash;when
he professes that there is no possibility of war in the
joint policy he advocates. But all the chances favor his side
of the argument. At any rate, I believe it is worth trying.
Such a policy means much for the United States. It means a
share, and an honorable share, in the great game which is to
engross the powers at the outset of the twentieth century. It
means a chance, and a good chance, for a market for our surplus
products. That market we <i>must have</i>. How else are we
to get it? Suppose we hold aloof and see their gates and
the gates of China shut in our faces by the powers of Continental
Europe, even as we have closed our gates against them
and their products&mdash;what are we to do with our surplus?
What are we to do if that surplus be thrown back on our
hands? We should have our choice of (1) going flat and
hopelessly bankrupt, as no nation was ever bankrupt before;
or (2) reducing our scale of living to the German, perhaps
even the Russian standard. It would be a hard choice.</p>

<p class="indent">So, in great measure, the Philippines mean for us a foothold
in the East and a strong leverage on China. Would
our co-operation be sought at this time, as it has been, not
only by England but by Germany, if George Dewey had not
sailed his ships into the harbor of Manila on the night of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;32]</span>
30th of April, 1898, dodging the sunken mines and torpedoes,
that he might on the morrow fire "the shot heard round the
world?" On that day and since then the world learned that
we are a nation not only of shopkeepers and money-grabbers,
but also of fighters; that in a prolonged war we stand unconquerable,
irresistable. A year and a day ago we were a nation;
to-day we are a power, and have only to assert ourselves
as such.</p>

<p class="indent">Doubtless it was in perfect good faith that Professor Bryce
wrote, a few weeks ago:</p>

<blockquote><p class="indent">"The United States has already a great and splendid
mission in building up between the oceans a free,
happy and prosperous nation of two hundred millions
of people.... The policy of creating great
armaments and of annexing territories beyond the
sea would be an un-American policy and a complete
departure from the maxims&mdash;approved by long
experience&mdash;of the illustrious founders of the Republic."</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">But I fancy the illustrious founders of the Republic would
see the wisdom, were they living to-day, of securing that advantage
which the fortunes of war has thrown into our lap.
I doubt if even their wisdom could have pointed a way
whereby we could relinquish the Philippines without also letting
go our prestige, if not also our honor. How can we
abandon them, either to internecine strife and anarchy, or,
more probably, to the cupidity of the powers whose statesmen
recognize the value of the islands, and have no compunctions
of conscience as to how they may be secured?</p>

<p class="indent">But I appeal to the founders of the Republic for another
and yet a stronger argument for holding fast to all our new
possessions, whether in the Pacific or in the Carribean Sea.
In the society of the illustrious dead let us go back for a little
space over the years that have elapsed since the civil war.
I am no pessimist; on the contrary, I see in every man and
every thing, however evil&mdash;so that the Lord gives them a
place in His own great scheme&mdash;an agency for good. But I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;33]</span>
do not find it easy to look back with pride or even patience
upon the last five and thirty years of this century. To me they
appear the most inglorious in our history. They have been
years of unequalled material growth, but, I think, they have
been years of unequalled moral deterioration also. We have
waxed fat, arrogant and ungodly. We have lost respect for
the law. We have learned to wink at corruption in high
places. The tongue of scandal wags unrebuked at the great,
the exalted. Greater fortunes than were ever known before
have been piled up; but if wealth and extravagance have
attained to new forms of luxury, so want has learned a keener
edge of suffering. We have seen labor in armed revolt and
anarchy showing its ugly head. Our federal Senate reeks
with disrepute. The golden calf has been set up in the market
place, the forum, even in the sanctuary.</p>

<p class="indent">This, to be sure, is but one side of the picture; there is
another and a brighter side. The period I speak of has been
athrill with intense activity, for good as well as evil. If vice
has been active, so have the agencies of virtue. Churches,
colleges, charitable and reform societies have sprung up and
grown as never before. When the call to arms came last
year it was answered on every hand&mdash;by the pampered favorites
of wealth and luxury as well as by the sons of toil.</p>

<p class="indent">Patriotism has not been dead, but sleeping. In time of
peril we have never lacked Deweys, Roosevelts, Funstons,
Hobsons, to fulfill the traditions of the race. Our fault has
been the absence of that patient, unsleeping vigilance which
is the price of honest government&mdash;not in war but in the
humdrum days of peace.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps it was only human that when the rebellion had
been crushed and the Union restored, we should relax somewhat
the strain of those four dreadful years and turn to long-neglected
private fortunes. The field lay fallow; a vast
public domain was opened; virgin forests awaited the axe.
In the flush of general gratitude for the preservers of the
Union the floodgates of public expenditure were opened wide,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
and its outpouring was not always watched with too keen
an eye. Too often the Republic was generous before it
was just.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover&mdash;and this is the point I wish especially to
make&mdash;we had no jealous or aggressive neighbors to vex our
frontier. The powers of Europe tore a leaf from the experience
of Napoleon III. when Mr. Seward warned that presumptuous
monarch out of Mexico, and left us to enjoy in
peace our new prosperity. The men who had been serving
their country at the front came home to mind their own private
concerns. Seeing the Republic preserved and safe from
intrusion, they turned to money-making with the same ardor
that had carried them to victory in war. Intent upon this
new occupation, they left politics to the politicians. The latter
were not slow to see their opportunity. Millions of immigrants,
unused to the franchise, untrained in the duties of
citizenship, came in at our open doors. Tens and hundreds
of thousands settled in the cities, where they became the
convenient tool of the "boss."</p>

<p class="indent">Under our system government is by parties, and parties
imply the existence of the "machine," an institution which,
like fire, is a good servant but may become a terrible master.
So long as the machine is operated for the good of the party
and the party for the state, the best results are possible. But
when state or city become subservient to party and party to
machine, such corruption is inevitable, as has been brought
to light more than once in our metropolis. And New York
is no worse than Chicago, or Philadelphia, or Boston, or Cincinnati.
All our large cities and some of our states are governed
by irresponsible pirates, who marshal their perfectly
organized bands of the ignorant and vicious, in defiance alike
of law and of the plain will of the intelligent and well-intentioned
majority; for these latter, we must assume, are
in the majority. It is only because they have been absorbed
in their private affairs that they have allowed the sacred prerogative
of government, the delicate machinery of the state,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
to become the special privileges of unscrupulous men whom
they would scarcely trust inside their houses. This dreadful
price we have paid for thirty years of "peaceful isolation."</p>

<p class="indent">It is the theory of democratic government that the majority
rules. Sixty-five years ago, de Tocqueville after his memorable
tour through our country recorded his "firm belief"
that for the Republic to be virtuous and progressive, we
had "<i>but to will it</i>." "It depends upon themselves," he
wrote, "whether the principle of equality is to lead them to
knowledge or barbarism, servitude or freedom, prosperity or
wretchedness." The French philosopher spoke truly, and it
is true now. If we have sunk into an ignoble servitude to the
baser elements of society, it is because those of the better sort
have "willed it"&mdash;not designedly, but through a no less reprehensible
apathy and blindness in respect of their obligations
to the state.</p>

<p class="indent">I may be sadly in error, but I believe the present low tone
of our internal politics to be due to the long and peaceful
isolation of the Republic. So I hold the comparative cleanliness
of English politics, and especially of the government of
their cities, such as London, Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham,
Manchester, Belfast, etc., to be a natural result of England's
activity in the high politics of the world. The continual danger,
in theory at least, of encroachment or invasion upon the
limitless frontier of that vast empire acts as a stimulant to
patriotism and invests even the petty politics of city and
parish with an interest beyond that of spoils. It is said that
England is never wholly at peace. In every continent her
standard is raised. Her nerves of sensibility and self-interest
run to the uttermost parts of the earth. They are rooted in
the hearts of her bravest and best, as well as of the lowliest
and most unworthy, and all join in common patriotism reaching
from pole to pole, not only of the material world but of
the social fabric. Therein is England's strength. Kipling's
lines are apropos:</p>

<p class="margin-left8">
"What should they know of England<br />
 Who only England know?"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span>
We have no need to follow abjectly in the footsteps of
England; I would not have the Republic walk behind any
other nation. We must work out our own salvation. And
we can. Latent in the heart of our people is the spirit and
the power for greater things than the world has ever seen.
Our place is in the vanguard of civilization. We have but to
take it. I have tried to show that self-interest in material
things pulls us in the same direction as does that higher,
spiritual interest, the aim and desire to be great of heart as
well as body; to be clean, dignified&mdash;a power for good. We
have suffered from what may well be called the perils of too
great security. In our engrossing pursuit of wealth we have
neglected higher things. I venture to quote the words of a
South Carolina judge, delivered in a recent lynching case,
which seem to me to touch the heart of the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">"We have made improvements," said he, "in our manufactures;
our railway systems have been improved; we have
spent money on our schools. But with what result? Swiftly
moving railways, whirling machinery, crowded factory towns
and schools&mdash;all these are infinitely inadequate to the glory
and civilization of the people. <i>Is our moral fibre growing
weaker?</i> The law has lost its sanctity during the past forty
years, and the essential foundation of all civilization is respect
for the law.... We can all do something, but first
of all we must recognize and humbly confess our shortcomings&mdash;the
sooner the better. We can have no real civilization
until we turn our faces to the light."</p>

<p class="indent">Is this indictment too severe? I believe not. Here in
the North we are not greatly vexed with lynchings; our disrespect
for the law assumes other forms. But the same weakening
of the moral fibre is to be observed everywhere as in
North Carolina. We too have need of humility; we must
confess our shortcomings. We have but to ask ourselves,
What would it avail civilization if we were to give to Santiago
de Cuba, or Manila, or Honolulu a government as essentially
corrupt as that which we tolerate in New York or Chicago?
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
Shall we offer to the savages of Luzon or Mindanao for a
model the spectacle of a government from which the rich, the
virtuous and the intelligent almost wholly abstain, shirking
their duties and relegating their most sacred prerogative to
the ignorant and depraved?</p>

<p class="indent">But if, on the other hand, we set up good government in
the colonies, how long shall we be content with misrule at
home? Not long, I promise you. "It is one of the most
beautiful compensations of this life," says the wise man,
"that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping
himself." No less true is this of nations. The eyes of the
world are upon us and the conscience of civilization will hold
us strictly accountable. As we deal with those ignorant wards
whom the God of Battles has given into our keeping, even so
shall we be dealt with. And in uplifting them from barbarism
so shall we be uplifted.</p>

<p class="indent">What nobler business is there, for man or nation? And
who should lead in it if not ourselves? First, though, let us
approach the work in true humility, confessing our own faults
and shortcomings. Guard us, heaven, against the triple sin
of pride, arrogance, and self-conceit. Let us ever keep in
mind those noble words of the young Laureate of Empire,
written for England at the climax of her greatness, but no less
fitting for ourselves:</p>

<p class="margin-left8">
"If, drunk with power, we loose<br />
 Wild words that have not Thee in awe&mdash;<br />
 Such boastings as the Gentiles use,<br />
 Or lesser breeds, without the Law&mdash;<br />
 Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,<br />
 Lest we forget, lest we forget!"</p>
